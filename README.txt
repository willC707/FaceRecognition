This details the files in the project Zip

Data holds the dataset

Figures holds plots

models hold saved models

sr_model is the SRGAN model
SR_ResNEt is the SR ResNet model

model is the FR model

train trains the SRGAN and FR models

Test tests the SRGAN and FR model
SR_ResNet_train trains the SR ResNet
SR_ResNet_test tests the SR ResNet

data_loader loads the dataset

These files do not utilize GPU resources

These files use Keras and Tensorflow

Visualize visulizes the SRGAN outputs
